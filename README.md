# Logistic_Regression
This project focuses on **Linear Regression**, a key statistical method used for predicting continuous outcomes based on various predictor variables. The primary objective is to analyze a dataset containing features such as carbon emissions, energy output, renewability index, cost efficiency, and sustainability to develop an effective predictive model. The project involves several critical steps: first, data collection and preprocessing, which includes cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and normalizing data; next, model development using libraries like `scikit-learn` to implement linear regression; followed by model evaluation through metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values to gauge the model's predictive performance. Additionally, data visualization techniques using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` will be employed to illustrate the relationships between variables and the effectiveness of the model. Ultimately, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the application of linear regression in real-world scenarios, highlighting its importance in making informed predictions across various domains.
